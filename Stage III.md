# Stage III Documentation
### January 2017

Stage I and Stage II of OSPC’s extrapolation procedure blow up and re-weight
each variable in the PUF-CPS matched data file (PUF) in order to match
macroeconomic projections of growth rates and aggregate totals. Stage I
determines per capita adjustment factors using both macro targets and
population growth rates. In Stage II, a linear programming algorithm is applied
in order to adjust the weights on each record so that all targeted variables
will sum up to their respective targets, while non-targeted variables also
stay in reasonable ranges.

While Stage II does target wage distribution, only the aggregate totals for
all other income variables are targeted and the resulting distributions of
those variables can be inconsistent with the distribution of those variables
may be inconsistent with what publicly available tax data shows. Stage III
fixes this by applying an adjustment factor to each record in the PUF based on
the level of AGI in the PUF. The factor is calculated so that it the aggregate
value of the variable targeted is not changed, but the distribution more
accurately reflects the data.

### Procedure

For the targeted variable, Stage III uses information from
[SOI Tax Stats ](https://www.irs.gov/uac/soi-tax-stats-individual-statistical-tables-by-size-of-adjusted-gross-income)
tables to determine the percent of its total is in each AGI bin for 2009-2014
(see appendix for the bin breakdown). The distribution is assumed to hold at
2014 levels for the years 2015-2026. These are the goal distributions.

For each year adjustment factors are needed, the variable is extrapolated to
that year using the same routine as in Tax-Calculator. The goal bin amounts
are then found using the goal distributions and aggregate total found in the
PUF.

The goal bin amounts are are then divided by the actual bin amounts, which are
calculated using the AGI variable found in the PUF before final processing, in
order to find a set of adjustment factors that can be multiplied by each
record in each AGI bin so that bin total reach their targeted levels. 

While this process does benefit from it’s simplicity, there are some
trade-offs. 

* Because each record is given a specific factor,  the size of the file
   holding these factors will be large.
* Because the factor is only being applied to one element of income, any
   correlation between two types of income will be lost. However, in the case
   of interest income, there do not appear to be any strong correlations with
   other income items (see appendix).

### Results
Because Stage III relies on AGI levels found in the original PUF rather than
recalculating AGI each year to account for growth as Tax-Calc does, the
resulting distribution is not perfect. Despite this, the final distribution
when including the adjustment is much more representative of the distribution
found in SOI data, as seen in figure A.
